            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p>This game is the digitalisation of the card game spyfall:<br>
                All players receive cards showing the same location like casino, spa, school etc.
                But one player receives a card that says "Spy" instead of the location.
                Players then start asking each other questions. The goal is to  find the spy and the spy's goal is to create good stories and to figure out the location.
